现实
Reality.

12

它们不仅仅是线性的
It's more than a linear path.

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,760
而是一个拥有无限可能的棱镜
It's a prism of endless possibility,

14
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,880
一个选择便能开辟出无数个现实
where a single choice can branch out into infinite realities,

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,260
创造出与你所知不同的平行世界
creating alternate worlds from the ones you know.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,470
我是观察者
I am the Watcher.

我将带领你们穿越这些新现实
I am your guide through these vast new realities.

银河系在你眼中是上千亿闪烁的光点
The galaxy, to your eyes, a hundred billion points of light.

22
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,190
你看着是光点
But where you see light, 

23
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,580
而我却看到了众多世界和其中的故事
I see worlds and the countless stories that fill them.

但在拥有无限可能的多元宇宙
But in a Multiverse of infinite possibility,

26
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,920
决定你命运的是你的本性
is your destiny determined by your nature

27
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,030
还是你世界的本质
or by the nature of your world?

28
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,320
放下  立刻放下
Drop it! Drop it now!

29
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,000
你是谁
Who are you?

30
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,430
表明身份
Identify yourself.

31
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,370
我吗  我只是个普通的拾荒者
Who, me? I am just an ordinary junker.

32
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,350
不过你们可能听说过我这个称号
But there is one name you may know me by.

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
天啊  星爵
Oh, my. Star-Lord!

34
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,890
我是你的大粉丝  你来这里干什么
I'm a huge fan of your work. What are you doing here?

35
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,270
我倒是没想到你是这种反应
That was not the reaction I was expecting.

36
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,620
住手  放尊重点
Stop! Show some respect.

37
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,670
这可是星爵  传奇法外之徒
This is the Star-Lord, legendary outlaw.

38
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,070
劫强济弱
Steals from the powerful and gives to the powerless.

39
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,530
我们要鞠躬吗  感觉应该要鞠躬
Should we be bowing? I feel like we should be bowing.

40
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,710
除非我们更应该下跪
I mean, unless we should be kneeling.

41
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,770
-都没必要  -拜托
- Neither is necessary. - Please.

42
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,080
-你可是勋爵  -这不是官方认定的头衔
- You are a lord. - It is not an official title.

43
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,280
也让我感到不自在
Nor is it one I am comfortable with.

44
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,850
你当然会谦虚了  典型星爵作风
Of course you would be humble. Classic Star-Lord.

45
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,420
真希望我不用夺走你手上那东西
I almost wish I didn't have to take that from you.

46
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,170
如此强大的东西  还是留在我手里更好
Surely something this powerful is better off in my hands.

47
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,150
可是我老大罗南超级严肃紧绷
It's just that my boss, Ronan, super, super intense.

48
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,280
但我可以被说服换工作的啦
But I could be convinced to make a career change.

49
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,060
谢谢你有这兴趣  但我们人员齐备了
Appreciate the interest, but we're all staffed up.

50
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,800
当然  完全明白
Oh, totally. Totally get it.

51
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,920
但至少现在我有机会和你切磋
But at least now I get to spar with you.

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,430
如果你真想这么做  就来吧
I guess if that's really what you want.

53
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,120
这会是我一生的荣幸
Oh, it shall be the honor of my life.

54
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,640
-我是不是不该用枪  -用吧
- Oh. Uh, should I not use the gun? - Go ahead.

55
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,700
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? - Please.

56
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,950
不  这不成问题
No, it's not a problem.

57
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,450
-我丢掉就是了  -没事
- I'll get rid of it. - It's okay.

58
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,190
-你确定吗  -来  尽管用枪吧
- You sure? - Go ahead, use the gun.

59
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,330
你真是太大方了
That is so generous of you.

60
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,130
-准备好了吗  -好了
- Ready? - Oh, yes.

61
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,760
你没让我失望  大人  如此敏捷灵活
You do not disappoint, my lord. So nimble, so spry.

62
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,460
我就在这  揍我
I'm right here. Hit me.

63
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,750
-大人  我不是有意...  -我们就是来打架的
- Oh. My Lord! I didn't mean to... - That is what we're here for.

64
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,700
再来一次  但这次出拳更快点
Do it again. But this time, faster.

65
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,330
-更用力  -真的吗
- Harder. - Really?

66
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,200
我几乎没动  揍我
I barely moved. Hit me.

67
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,150
典型星爵作风
Classic Star-Lord.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,450
这下我几乎有点内疚了
Now I almost feel bad.

69
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,030
比起我以前雇过的人  他也不算差
Well, I have hired worse.

70
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,290
不许动  劫掠者  你寡不敌众
Freeze, Ravager. We have you outnumbered.

71
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,970
表面看起来是  但劫掠者从不单干
It would appear, but a Ravager never flies solo.

72
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,280
我说  "劫掠者从不单干"
I said, "A Ravager never flies solo."

73
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,350
这是你的口号吗
Uh, is that some kind of catchphrase?

74
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,760
你害我担心了一下下
You had me worried for a second.

75
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,330
那睡美人是谁
Who's the Sleeping Beauty?

76
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,010
新招的  他也想要这个
A new recruit. He was after this as well.

77
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,610
热信号高到爆表
Thermal signature's off the charts.

78
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,040
如果我们想找点真正的乐子
You know, if we wanted to have some real fun,

79
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,080
就该像从前那样
we'd make like the old days

80
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,820
把这危险玩意卖给出价最高者
and sell this bad boy to the highest bidder.

81
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,450
如果还要像以前一样  你现在只剩一半牙齿了
If we made like the old days, you'd only have half of your teeth.

82
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,870
再说  你肯定宁愿用来传送到
Besides, wouldn't you rather use it to jump-start

83
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,760
克瑞罗人那颗快灭亡的星球  拯救他们免遭灭顶之灾
the Krylorians' dying star, save their system from extinction?

84
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,630
你和我一样清楚  任何宝物的价值
You know as well as I, no treasure is worth as much

85
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,860
都比不上它所能做出的贡献
as the good that can be done with it.

86
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,990
好孩子
Ah. That's my boy.

87
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,700
尽管我们的英雄的命运可能在天上的群星
Though our hero's destiny might lie in the stars above,

88
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,420
但他的旅程起点要更靠近地球
the beginning of his journey was much more down-to-earth.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,780
{\an8}地球  瓦坎达

90
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,640
我受够了住在泡泡里
I am tired of living in a bubble.

91
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,040
外面有广阔的世界  爸爸
There's an entire world out there, Baba.

92
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,510
是啊  一个充满战争暴力和仇恨的世界
Yes, one of war, violence, hatred.

93
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,520
那个世界没什么能给瓦坎达的
That world has nothing to offer Wakanda.

94
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,730
肯定不止  但我们必须有足够的勇气去寻找它
There must be more. But we must be brave enough to search for it.

95
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,750
我明白  儿子
I do understand, my son.

96
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,930
虽然你的血管里流着国王的血
Though the blood of a king runs through your veins,

97
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,600
却有一颗探索者的心
it is pumped by the heart of an explorer.

98
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,330
但我去过更广阔的世界
But as someone who has ventured out into the greater world,

99
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,370
我向你保证
let me assure you,

100
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,910
你在那里只能找到毁灭和痛苦
all you will find there is destruction and pain.

101
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,990
那些人不懂我们的生活方式
Those people do not understand our way of life.

102
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,510
你所说的命运只是一个等式
What you call destiny is just an equation,

103
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,090
几个变量的乘积
a product of variables.

104
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,320
对的地点  对的时间  或者有时候是
Right place, right time, or in some instances,

105
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,280
错的地点  错的时间
the wrong place at the wrong time.

106
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,460
如同命运的安排  就在那一刻
As fate would have it, at that very moment,

107
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,740
一艘劫掠者的飞船抵达地球
a Ravager spacecraft was arriving on Earth

108
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,490
绑架天神伊戈的后裔
to abduct the spawn of the Celestial, Ego.

109
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,010
酷
Cool.

110
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,520
但在这一宇宙
But in this universe,

111
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,480
勇度将任务外包给了他的属下
Yondu outsourced the assignment to his subordinates.

112
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,720
你们这群蠢货抓错了孩子
You morons grabbed the wrong kid.

113
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,850
别这么武断嘛  船长
Uh-uh. Not so fast, Captain.

114
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,720
两个看孔  两个听孔  一个吃孔
Two see holes, two hear holes, one eat hole.

115
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,810
每样标准都符合
Everything checks out.

116
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,550
你们真觉得这个长得像彼得·奎尔吗
Does this really look like Peter Quill to y'all?

117
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,210
我不知道  我看所有人类长得都一样
Sure. I don't know. All humans look alike to me.

118
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,490
他所处的宇宙读数几乎爆掉了我们的仪表盘
The cosmic readings where he was took nearly broke our dial.

119
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,990
要说那里有什么不是地球本身的东西
If there was anything not from that planet on that planet,

120
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,580
就是他了
it's there.

121
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,060
我的家建在一块古老的振金陨石上
Well, my home is built on an ancient Vibranium meteorite.

122
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,890
你被带到这里好像不怎么害怕  孩子
You sure don't seem too freaked out about all this, kid.

123
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,930
你一个人在那里干什么
What you doing out there all by yourself anyway?

124
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,230
-探索世界  -听起来很好玩
- Exploring the world. - Sounds fun.

125
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,610
但何必在一个世界停留
But why stop at one world, huh?

126
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,310
毕竟我们可以带你看所有世界
When we can show you all of them?

127
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,110
-敬劫掠者  -劫掠者
- Ravagers! - Ravagers!

128
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,850
星爵  如果你必须选一个最爱
Star-Lord, if you had to pick a favorite...

129
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,520
我真的说不出
Really, I could not say.

130
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,810
我知道  那么多次抢劫  救了那么多星球
I know, I know, so many heists, so many planets saved.

131
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,230
但你肯定有一个最爱吧
Still, you must have one.

132
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,900
就选一个怎么选得出来
How could you choose just one?

133
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,790
塔尔纳克斯四号的中央银行劫案怎么样
Oh! What about the Central Bank heist of Tarnax IV?

134
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,500
斯库鲁人都死有余辜  对吗
Never hurts to hurt a Skrull, right?

135
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,730
克拉林的牙就是那次活儿挣出来的
That job paid for Kraglin's teeth.

136
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,040
你武装安卡拉抵抗组织那次呢
How about when you armed the Ankaran resistance?

137
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,160
天啊  那次我差点没命
Oh, man. Barely made it out of that one.

138
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,850
你到底是怎么阻止疯狂泰坦灭霸
How exactly did you stop Thanos, the Mad Titan,

139
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,340
不让他随机抹掉半个宇宙的  不
from decimating half of the universe? Oh, no.

140
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,970
我够男子汉  错了就承认
I'm a big enough man to admit when I'm wrong.

141
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,090
特查拉让我明白  重新分配宇宙的资源
T'Challa here showed me there was more than one way

142
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,310
不止一个方法
to reallocate the universe's resources.

143
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,300
有时你的武器库中最厉害的武器不过是一个有力的论据
Sometimes the best weapon in your arsenal is just a good argument.

144
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,950
是  指挥官
Aye, aye, Commander.

145
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,730
尽管我仍然觉得  我的计划也并非一无是处
Although I still assert my plan was not without its merits.

146
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,230
-又来了  -拜托
- Here we go. - Please.

147
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,740
但那依然是种族灭绝  大块头
Pretty sure it's still just genocide, big guy.

148
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,990
我相当肯定那种办法效率高
And I'm pretty sure it's efficient.

149
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,050
你的钱在这儿不能用
Your money is no good here.

150
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,630
-求你了  -不  真的  我们只收现金
- Please. - No, seriously. We only take cash.

151
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,070
抱歉  我有现金
Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh... I have cash.

152
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,440
慢着  你是星爵本爵
Wait. You are the Star-Lord.

153
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,650
你阻止了克里人入侵  拯救了我的家园
You saved my home world from a Kree invasion.

154
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,260
-一天就完成了  -不  用了好几天呢
- All in a day's work. - No, it took several days.

155
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,170
其实是六天
Six, in fact.

156
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,790
我们拍张合照发给我妻子和女儿吧
Let us take a picture to send to my wife and daughter.

157
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,130
我更想...
I would prefer--

158
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,710
我们再拍一张  你太难看了  我很好看
Oh, we should take another one. You look terrible. I look great.

159
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,970
-这张就挺好的  -不  我坚持
- I'm sure it's fine. - No, I insist.

160
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,790
-你这张太丑了  -不见得哦
- It is a truly awful picture of you. - I don't know.

161
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,020
我觉得他很好看
He looks pretty good from where I'm standing.

162
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,670
星云
Nebula.

163
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,000
你好  查查
Hey, Cha-Cha.

164
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,720
你这个战利品很值钱
Pretty valuable loot you got here.

165
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,650
大个子知道你拿到这个了吗
The big guy know you have this?

166
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,060
你是说你父亲吗
You mean your father?

167
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,320
他很幸运我只是叫他大个子
He's lucky I call him the big guy.

168
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,800
你知道吗  他现在做园艺了
You know, he gardens now.

169
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,820
你应该和他谈谈  他真的改变了
You should talk to him. He really has changed.

170
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,330
但过去并不会改变
The past doesn't.

171
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,660
你也仍把你的过去戴在脖子上
You still wear your past around your neck.

172
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,810
你想过回去吗
You ever think of going back?

173
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,710
也没有什么东西值得回去了
Not much to go back to.

174
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,260
我小的时候  勇度试图把我送回瓦坎达
When I was young, Yondu attempted to return me to Wakanda...

175
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,360
但是那里已经被毁掉了
but it had been destroyed.

176
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,550
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,330
只是又一场毫无意义的战争
Just another senseless war.

178
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,760
爸爸警告过我  人类只会带来战争
Baba warned that was all humans know.

179
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,690
他说得没错
Turns out he was right.

180
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,970
你失去了你的家  但你拯救了所有人的家
You lost your home, and now you save everyone else's.

181
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,810
这就是讽刺之处吧
That's the name of this tune, huh?

182
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,070
差不多吧
Something like that.

183
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,260
那么  我有一份工作很适合你
Well, then, do I have a job for you.

184
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,910
它们被称为创世纪的余烬
They're called the Embers of Genesis.

185
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,500
来自一颗远古超新星富含营养的宇宙尘埃
Nutrient-rich cosmic dust from an ancient supernova

186
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,910
拥有将整个生态系统地球化的力量
with the power to terraform entire ecosystems.

187
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,800
只需一盎司
With one ounce,

188
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,830
就可以在几分钟内治愈一个濒死的星球
you can heal a dying planet in minutes.

189
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,620
如果我们能够装满带走的话
And with a payload the size we're talking...

190
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,810
我们能养活无数世界中的千千万万人
We could feed billions of people on millions of worlds,

191
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,020
让饥饿从整个银河系中彻底消失
and eradicate hunger across the galaxy.

192
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,990
别告诉这位灭绝队长  你会扫了他的兴
Don't tell Captain Genocide over here. You might spoil his fun.

193
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,080
这位新人挺搞笑的
New guy's pretty funny.

194
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,570
-我以为你喜欢单干  女儿  -等等
- I thought you work alone, daughter. - Wait, wait, wait.

195
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,710
你是说她是你的骨肉吗
You mean she's your offspring?

196
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,820
-收养的  -说来话长了
- Adopted. - It's a long story.

197
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,220
我一直想让他们去做心理咨询
I've been trying to get them into counseling.

198
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,140
-那目标是谁  -坦利亚·蒂万  人称
- So who's the mark? - Taneleer Tivan, also known as...

199
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,220
收藏者
The Collector?

200
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,710
就是整个星系黑社会最残忍的头目吗
As in the most ruthless kingpin in the intergalactic underworld?

201
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,920
-等等  我还以为是你呢  -以前是
- Wait, I thought that was you. - It was.

202
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,800
但我改过自新之后
But when I went straight,

203
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,490
蒂万趁机占据了权力的空缺
Tivan saw an opening and filled the power vacuum.

204
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,870
我们都同意收藏者非常危险
We can all agree the Collector is dangerous.

205
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,750
提醒你们一下  收藏者不提供牙科服务
FYI, the Collector does not offer dental.

206
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,280
特查拉  这是在自杀
This is suicide, T'Challa.

207
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,320
就算是我都无法突破他的防线
Not even I can get through his defenses.

208
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,770
你明白吗  这个疯子都不会发善心杀了你
You dig? This maniac won't do you the kindness of killing you.

209
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,990
他会把你解刨  用于科学项目
He'll dissect you for a science project,

210
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,860
把剩下的部分裱起来挂在墙上
frame whatever's left and hang you up on the wall.

211
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,650
那我就把你算作"尚未决定"了
So should I mark you down as undecided?

212
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,370
只要牵扯到收藏者  我们就不参与
So long as the Collector's involved, we are not.

213
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,210
你也许是这艘飞船的灵魂  但我仍是船长
You may be the soul of this ship, but I am still the captain.

214
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,700
我们是劫掠者  我们不会在战斗中退缩
We are Ravagers. We do not back down from a fight.

215
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,830
不  不对  我们只是劫富济贫而已
No, no. We steal from the rich and give to the poor,

216
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,760
就像你们地球上的那个英雄  对吧
just like that earthling folk hero of yours, right?

217
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,470
-罗宾·里奇  -是罗宾汉
- Robin Leach. - Robin Hood.

218
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,560
管他呢  这才是我们的生活
Whatever. That's our racket.

219
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,760
我们一直都是偷别人口袋里的小钱
We've been picking pockets for loose coins.

220
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,050
如果我们真的要改变银河系
If we truly want to change the galaxy,

221
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,550
完成我们该做的事情
accomplish all we set out to do,

222
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,730
那我们该去抢银行了
then it's time we robbed the bank.

223
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,520
老天  孩子  我永远没办法拒绝你
Oh, jeez. Never have been any good at saying no to you, kid.

224
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,870
收藏者对于动植物奇珍有着著名的嗜好
The Collector's got a famous kink for exotic flora and fauna.

225
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,660
余烬和他的其他战利品都被收藏在这里
The Embers will be housed with the rest of his conquests, here.

226
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,580
一个博物馆  同时也是他的行动基地
A museum that doubles as his base of operations.

227
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,890
在一位远古神祇头颅中的一个采矿殖民地
A mining colony in a severed head of an ancient celestial being.

228
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,690
{\an8}无存知地  采矿殖民地

229
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,580
他让黑暗军团来进行安保工作
He's got the Black Order doing security.

230
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,400
相信我  这可是个坏消息
Take it from me, they're bad news.

231
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,050
你打算怎么从他们面前溜进去
How do you plan on sneaking past them?

232
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,370
我不这么做  我要像一位淑女一样去敲门
I don't. I'm gonna knock on their front door like a lady.

233
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,210
星云女士  尤冬塔船长
My Lady Nebula. Captain Udonta.

234
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,760
我来接您去见我的主人
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

235
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,360
我和勇度会假扮成卖家
Yondu and I will pose as sellers

236
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,970
想要出手你在莫拉格找到的那个球
looking to unload that orb you recovered on Morag.

237
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,360
但实际上  特查拉会躲在箱子里
But really, it'll be T'Challa inside.

238
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,890
这是我们的安全主管  暗夜比邻星
Our head of security, Proxima Midnight.

239
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,260
看起来博物馆里办了个展览
Looks like they got an exhibit running the museum.

240
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,650
站住  安全扫描
Hold it. Security scan.

241
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,290
这时候你负责转移他们的注意力
And that is when you cause the distraction.

242
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,580
停  我还以为我们是假打
Stop. I thought we were faking it.

243
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,980
你再管我叫灭绝队长试试  新人
Yeah, well, try calling me Captain Genocide again, new guy.

244
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,480
灭绝队长...
Captain Genocide...

245
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,190
劫掠者会制造一场暴乱
The Ravagers will start a riot,

246
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,980
让他们不会注意到黑暗军团
drawing the attention of the Black Order.

247
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,350
这边有情况
We have a situation.

248
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,850
各单位各就各位
All units report to our position.

249
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,310
勇度和星云转移了收藏者的注意力
Now, Yondu and Nebula are free to distract the Collector,

250
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,860
我就可以去寻找余烬了
so that I can search for the Embers.

251
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,670
太棒了
Amazing.

252
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,540
我没有意见  完美的计划
I have no notes. A perfect plan.

253
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,260
怎么可能出任何问题呢
What could possibly go wrong?

254
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,190
我向您引见坦利亚·蒂万  收藏家
I present to you, Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

255
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,330
我亲爱的星云
Oh, my dearest Nebula.

256
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,350
看见你真的让我...
Aren't you a sight for sore...

257
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,320
眼前一亮  抱歉  实在忍不住开玩笑
Eye. Forgive me, I couldn't help myself.

258
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,910
死变态  你要是没意见的话  
Hey, you, creep-show. If it's all the same to you,

259
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,010
还是赶紧说正经事吧
I'd just as soon get on with it.

260
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,270
只谈生意
All business?

261
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,180
如果我没记错的话
And to think I'm old enough

262
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,160
劫掠者以前很有意思的
to remember when the Ravagers used to be fun.

263
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,250
那有什么办法  我们走正道了  我现在是正人君子
What can I say? We went straight and I got square.

264
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,160
你们男生八卦完了的话  我带了你想要的东西来
Hey, if you boys are done gossiping, I brought what you asked.

265
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,180
收藏品规模比我预期得大多了
The collection is much bigger than I anticipated.

266
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,350
这些折磨究竟是为什么
All this suffering, and for what?

267
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,620
我猜  他是在弥补某一个很严重的问题
My guess, he's compensating for something big.

268
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,980
或者很小的东西  如果你明白我的意思的话
Or small, if you catch my drift.

269
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,920
你真是一只能言善道的鸭子
You are quite articulate for a duck.

270
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,920
你这么说  先生  就少见多怪了
That, sir, is very close-minded.

271
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,280
我在找一样东西
You know, I, um... I'm looking for something.

272
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,090
创世纪的余烬  你知道在哪里吗
The Embers of Genesis. Do you know where I can find them?

273
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,530
宇宙植物群  走到大厅尽头
Cosmic flora, down the hall.

274
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,140
看见冰霜巨人左转然后看见克朗人马上右转
Take a Louie at the Frost Giants, a hard Ralph at the Kronans.

275
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,180
你会看到一个精灵文学的指示牌
You'll see a sign for Elvish literature.

276
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,190
别管那个  纯扯淡
Ignore that, total snooze.

277
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,360
不管了
Screw it.

278
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,050
你带路
Give me the tour.

279
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,390
俗话说得好  "当你迷失方向
You know what they say, "When you're out of luck,

280
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,660
记得去找鸭子"
"Always go duck."

281
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,650
-我非常确定没有这句俗话  -我确定有的
- I'm pretty sure no one says that. - Oh, they say it.

282
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,170
-真的吗  -肯定有
- Really? - Totally.

283
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,610
劫掠者
The Ravagers?

284
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,600
这是声东击西  拉响警报  封锁大楼
It's a diversion. Sound the alarms, lock down the building.

285
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,010
警报响了
The flashy flash.

286
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,430
你总能带来欢乐
You always know how to bring the fun.

287
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,020
等一下  我需要补充水份
Hold on, I need to hydrate.

288
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,940
-我们得走了  -你去哪  回来
- We have to go. - Where are you going? Come back.

289
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,300
你疯了吗  欢乐时光刚刚开始
Are you crazy? Happy hour just started.

290
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,350
{\an8}瓦坎达

291
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,760
这...  这不可能
It... It cannot be.

292
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:08,030
我的孩子  特查拉  瓦坎达的王子
My son, T'Challa, Crown Prince of Wakanda,

293
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,710
被一架外星人飞船从地球绑架
was abducted from Earth by an alien spacecraft.

294
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,440
如果你知道他的下落
If you have any information regarding his whereabouts,

295
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,430
请与这个归航信标联系
we ask that you respond to this homing beacon.

296
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,340
-特查拉...  -爸爸
- And T'Challa... - Baba.

297
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,170
...如果你还活着
...if you are out there,

298
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,650
你在这夜空里
you're one bright burning light 

299
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,280
无数繁星之中
in the night sky of billions,

300
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,520
我们会逐个搜寻  直到找到你为止
and we will search every last one of them until we find you

301
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,450
不管是这一架飞船  还是下一架
on this plane or the next.

302
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,270
查查  我希望你能理解
Oh, Cha-Cha, I hope you can understand,

303
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,590
我欠了收藏者一笔债  得用你来偿还
I had a debt with the Collector and you were the payment.

304
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:03,360
特查拉  现在是展示伟大逃脱技巧的时候了
Oh, T'Challa, now it's time for one of your great escapes.

305
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,920
你还好吗  孩子
You okay, kid?

306
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:06,940
你骗了我
You lied to me!

307
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,490
我是在保护你
I was protecting you.

308
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,870
你们是在说这次任务呢  还是什么"家庭内部事务"
Are we talking about the mission? Or is this "Family stuff"?

309
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,110
你告诉我我的家园被毁了
You told me my homeland had been destroyed.

310
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,380
我的家人被杀害了
My family killed.

311
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,710
这叫保护我吗
How is that protecting me?

312
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,810
看来是家庭内部事务
Whoa. Guess it's family stuff.

313
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,980
有时候你得先被骗才能知道真相
Sometimes you need to hear a lie to see the truth.

314
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,640
你就像我一样  特查拉
You're just like me, T'Challa.

315
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,340
我和你一点不像
I am nothing like you.

316
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,040
你是个探索者  星爵
You're an explorer, Star-Lord.

317
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,250
像你这样的人  像我们这样的人
And for people like you, like us,

318
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,170
过去不过就是个牢笼
the past ain't nothing but a prison.

319
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,360
你不属于那边的他们
You don't belong down there with them.

320
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,710
你应该在这和我们一起  和你的家人
You belong up here with us, with your family.

321
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,770
你不是我家人
You are not my family.

322
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,190
从来都不是
You never were.

323
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,580
该死  这话真伤人
Damn, that hurts.

324
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,210
收藏者要见你
The Collector is ready for you.

325
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,720
我必须为星云刚刚制造的尴尬场面向你道歉
I must apologize for all that awkwardness back there with Nebula.

326
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,700
我着实厌恶戏剧性情节
I simply abhor drama.

327
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,780
从你的装扮上可看不出来
Your outfit would suggest otherwise.

328
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,490
你想从我这得到什么  蒂万
What is it you want with me, Tivan?

329
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,290
餐厅里有一面白墙
There is a blank wall in the commissary

330
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,620
我还没为那选好合适的展品
that I just haven't been able to find the right piece for.

331
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,930
我就是个普通人  实在算不上艺术品
I am just an ordinary human, hardly a work of art.

332
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:35,250
不得不承认  我看你是肉体凡胎  确实
I must admit now that I see you in the flesh, you are.

333
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,510
你确定自己不会飞
Are you sure you can't fly

334
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,560
或者从眼里发射激光之类的吗
or shoot lasers out of your eyes or something?

335
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,970
打几个回合  你就知道了
Let's go a few rounds and you can find out.

336
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,370
算了  你还是在笼子里比较好
Pass. I prefer you in the cage.

337
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,610
在我的故乡
Where I come from,

338
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,470
把人关进笼子的人  都会被历史唾弃
history has never looked kindly on those who lock men in cages.

339
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,410
乌木喉  记下来
Maw, make a note.

340
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,830
看来他确实有超能力
It appears he does have a super power after all.

341
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,240
他能用自己的伪善把人活活烦死
He can bore someone to death using only his sanctimony.

342
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,320
我们还是别浪费墙面空间了
Let's not waste the wall space.

343
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,510
把他解剖  然后大卸八块
Dissect him and strip his remains for parts.

344
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,950
我的女儿
Daughter of mine.

345
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,680
你怎么能这么对我们
How could you do this to us?

346
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,290
对我最好的朋友  特查拉  你真是差劲到家了
To my best friend, T'Challa. You are the worst.

347
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,080
但还得说  什么事都有两面
But then again, there are two sides to every story.

348
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,400
放松  新来的  我是来救你们的
Relax, new guy. I'm here to rescue you.

349
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,340
中途变卦可不像你的风格
Not like you to change your mind.

350
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,130
我没有  原本计划就是如此
Oh, I didn't. This was always the plan.

351
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,980
我早就告诉特查拉
I told T'Challa that the

352
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,650
收藏者在星际跳跃后就盯上他了
Collector was after him right from the jump.

353
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,560
-任务是什么  -更像个诡计
- What is this job? - More of a ruse.

354
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,450
我欠收藏者这么一笔债
You see, I have this debt with the Collector

355
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,370
而他要讨债了
and, well, he's come to collect.

356
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,600
-收什么  -简言之  你  查查
- And what does he want? - In a word, you, Cha-Cha.

357
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,680
我不知道那艘瓦坎达飞船的事
I had no idea about that Wakandan ship.

358
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,590
我只知道  我们有机会
All I knew was that we had

359
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,880
让我和收藏者的帐一笔勾销
an opening to settle my debt with the Collector,

360
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,350
还能在他鼻子底下  偷走创世记的余烬
and steal the Embers right out from under him.

361
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,130
这么说  这一切都是个三重圈套
So, all of this has been a triple-cross?

362
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,370
什么  典型的星爵作风
What? Classic Star-Lord.

363
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,020
是特查拉安排不要告诉你的
Hey, it was T'Challa's idea to keep you in the dark.

364
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,910
因为他知道我才不会让他跳进圈套
'Cause he knew I would never let him walk into a trap.

365
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,310
看看现在我们的下场
Look where we ended up.

366
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,150
所有分散注意的行为
All a distraction,

367
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,390
都是掩护我
providing me the necessary

368
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,900
才能拿到这个  创世记的余烬
cover to obtain this, the Embers of Genesis.

369
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,360
老天  你们可真行
Hot damn. You guys are good.

370
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,080
-那特查拉怎么办  -别担心
- What about T'Challa? - Not to worry.

371
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,180
他把逃跑计划就藏在胸前
He's keeping his escape plan close to his chest.

372
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,650
不  不是那样的  卡丽娜
No, not like that, Carina.

373
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,450
就以奴隶的标准衡量  你也很愚蠢
Even by a slave standard, you are foolish.

374
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,100
我喜欢你刚才说的  不要把人关进笼子的话
I liked that thing you said about not locking people in cages.

375
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,410
谢谢  我永远都欠你情
Thank you. I am forever in your debt.

376
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,090
囚犯们逃跑了
The prisoners have escaped.

377
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,880
所有人都去第七区
All units to sector seven.

378
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,770
什么人从派对离开也不道别
What kind of being leaves a party without saying goodbye?

379
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,140
但你好像经常遇到这样的事
Something tells me this happens to you a lot.

380
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,540
力道真不错  是吧
Packs quite a wallop, does it not?

381
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,920
我从一个超级聒噪的克朗人遗骸上偷来的
I hacked it off the carcass of a terribly chatty Kronan.

382
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,570
当然  如果这不是你的风格
Of course, if that's not your style,

383
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,770
我们还有很多花样可玩  看着
there's plenty more we can play with. Observe.

384
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,300
用从黑暗精灵统治者那
A dagger forged in dark matter

385
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,810
夺来的暗物质锻造的匕首
taken from the ruler of the Dark Elves.

386
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,780
或者你更喜欢有优雅气质的物件
Or perhaps you prefer something a touch more elegant?

387
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,310
那女人可真有品味
Oh. That woman had taste!

388
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,960
一柄死亡之剑  来自阿斯加德死亡女神
A necrosword, courtesy of the Asgardian Goddess of Death.

389
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,390
-快跑  -我们跑着呢
- Run! - We were running.

390
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,830
好吧  我们再跑快点
Okay, we'll run faster.

391
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,580
-你们先上飞船  -你疯了吗
- Get to the ship. - Are you crazy?

392
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,350
-你不可能一人拦住他们  -不是疯了...
- You'll never take them yourself. - Not crazy...

393
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:26,890
是生气[疯了]
Mad.

394
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,040
真可惜
A pity.

395
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,820
你抛弃了你的家园和家人
You abandoned your home and family,

396
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,280
但现在  你的新家庭抛弃了你
and now, your new family has abandoned you.

397
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,200
真是因果报应
Karma.

398
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,180
可能你从没听说过  劫掠者从不单独行动
Maybe you haven't heard, a Ravager never flies solo.

399
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,180
勇度  太好了  狂欢这才开始
Yondu, sweet! Now it's a party.

400
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:23,510
我决不可能丢下我孩子就离开
Ain't no way in hell I was going to leave here without my kid.

401
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,160
尝尝这个
Eat this.

402
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,690
快走  拉闸
Let's go. Punch it!

403
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,140
-那勇度和特查拉怎么办  -他们不会有事
- What about Yondu and T'Challa? - I'm sure they're doing fine.

404
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,110
-有主意了吗  -偷
- Okay, any ideas? - Sticky fingers.

405
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,190
行得通
Could work.

406
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,070
-谁来执行  -你
- Who's the glue? - You are.

407
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,090
-因为你骗了我  -说得过去
- Because you lied to me. - Fair point.

408
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,580
你就这点本事吗
Is that all you got?

409
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,820
你觉得这能困住我吗
You think this can contain me?

410
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,960
天真  不论你在哪  躲得有多远
Cute. No matter where you go or how far you hide,

411
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,420
银河系里没有一处地方不在我的掌控之下
there is not a corner in this galaxy beyond my grasp.

412
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,920
是是  无所谓  好演讲
Sure, sure. Whatever. Cool story.

413
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,220
我相信你知道该怎么办
I trust you'll know what to do with this.

414
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,960
我是有些想法
Oh, I have some ideas.

415
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,220
卡丽娜  能把我的手环给我吗
Carina, can I have my bracelet now?

416
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,070
不要碰  卡丽娜  别碰
No touching, Carina. No!

417
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,420
不  不  不不  别动  停下
No, no, no, no. Stay. Stop!

418
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,530
停下  想想  我关照了你们
Stop and think. I took care of all of you.

419
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,320
让你们能有住的地方
I put a roof over your heads.

420
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,430
因果报应
Oh. Karma.

421
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,750
我们步走不可能出的去
We're never getting out on foot.

422
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,430
那我们就上天
Then we'll take to the skies.

423
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,280
所有成员奇迹般地都在场了
All crew members present and accounted for by some miracle.

424
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,990
那我们集合地见
Then I will see you at the rendezvous point.

425
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,480
收到  查查
Copy that, Cha-Cha.

426
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,260
看来这儿有个偷渡者
Looks like we've got a stowaway.

427
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,160
你总是会对出走的人心软
You always did have a soft spot for runaways.

428
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,200
-听着  特查拉  我只想说  -没有必要
-Look, T'Challa, I just wanted to say-- -There's no need.

429
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,450
是我告诉你我想要出去看看世界
I was the one who told you I wanted to see the world.

430
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,770
你只不过是带我领略了宇宙
All you did was show me the universe.

431
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,090
是啊  她可是个尤物  对吗
Oh, yeah. She really is a beaut, isn't she?

432
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,260
这里一直有家的感觉
I've always felt at home up here.

433
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,530
但现在  领略了一切之后
But now, knowing everything,

434
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,290
我不太确信我的归属在哪
I'm not quite sure where I belong.

435
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,450
我已经看过太多太空旅行者了  孩子
Seen a lot of space travelers in my day, kid.

436
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,070
但如果说从你身上我知道了什么
And if I've learned anything from watching you,

437
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,630
在任何星球上  任何人种中
on any planet, among any people,

438
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:03,710
这银河系里没有一个地方不能容纳你
there ain't no place in this galaxy where you don't belong.

439
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,690
但你想在哪  那才是问题所在  不是吗
Where you want to be, that's the question, isn't it?

440
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,890
你仅仅需要
You're just gonna have to

441
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,930
遵从你内心的想法  星爵先生
follow your heart on that one, Mr. Star-Lord.

442
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,450
-爸爸  -我的儿子  我的儿子
- Baba. - My son, my son.

443
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,500
我就知道你会回到我们身边
I knew you would find your way home to us.

444
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,370
我很抱歉拖了这么久
I'm sorry it took me so long.

445
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,520
让我向你介绍下这一路伴我同行的家人
Let me introduce you to the family I made along the way.

446
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,510
您一定就是特查拉的父亲
Uh, you must be T'Challa's father.

447
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,160
很荣幸见到您  先生  您儿子是星际英雄
Uh, pleased to meet you, sir. Your son is a galactic hero.

448
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,950
我的朋友  那听起来像是种族灭绝
My friend, that sounds an awful lot like genocide.

449
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,260
不不  死亡是随机的
No, no, no. Because it's random.

450
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,110
不得不说  还更有效率
And I might add, efficient.

451
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,660
爸爸
Dad!

452
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,390
如果你非要搞清我们的关系
I mean, if you really wanted to put a label on it,

453
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,810
特查拉和我是最好的朋友
T'Challa and I are best friends.

454
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,450
没错  跳跃点最爽了
Oh, yeah, jump points are the best.

455
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,910
你的脸会扭曲  但其实很有意思
They make your face all scrambly, but they're a lot of fun.

456
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,330
我还是很疑惑
I am still wondering 

457
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:18,970
我的儿子到底怎么上了你的飞船
how exactly my son came to be in your spaceship.

458
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,960
说来有趣  陛下  其实我接了份任务
Funny story, Your Highness. You see, I took this job--

459
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,170
我迷路了  爸爸  勇度发现了我
I was lost, Baba. Yondu found me.

460
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,780
从一个家庭的团聚到另一个
And from one family reunion to another...

461
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,250
*我看到了你的双眸*
* I saw your eyes *

462
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,130
*你使我微笑*
* And you made me smile *

463
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,480
不好意思  我们歇业了
Uh, sorry. We're closed.

464
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,290
怎么  彼得  不能为你的老父亲抽些空吗
What, Peter? Can't spare a little time for dear old Dad?

465
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,990
很可惜这可能会招致世界末日
Too bad this might spell the end of the world.

466
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,580
但这是另一天要发生的故事了 
But that's a story for another day.

467
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,670
*我正在坠入爱河*
* I was falling in love *

468
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:11,350
{\an8}献给我们的朋友  灵感源泉  英雄

469
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:11,350
